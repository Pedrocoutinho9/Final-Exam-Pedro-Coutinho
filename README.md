Java Script Final Exam

This is my final exam using html,css and java script

I created a website using HTML,CSS and JS. The website is basically a portfolio of 5 projects together in just 1 website. Some fetures that i add was: Changing Background color, error messages and arrows to add or take out numbers in projects that use numbers to work!

To run this Project, Just clone my Repo into your computer, and use some git hub extension like Live server to run in your favorite web browser :)
